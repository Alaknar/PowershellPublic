Script originally written by [Oliver Kieselbach](https://github.com/okieselbach).

I've updated it to work with [Microsoft.Graph.Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.authentication/?view=graph-powershell-1.0), instead of Microsoft.Graph.Intune.

Help included. Oliver's aritcle explaining usage can be found [here](https://oliverkieselbach.com/2020/02/06/get-back-your-intune-powershell-scripts/).
